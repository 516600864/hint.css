#Setting up
**Hint.css** uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for the build process which you need to have installed on your system.

Also there are two Grunt tasks required to build the library:

1. grunt-contrib-mincss `npm install grunt-contrib-mincss`

2. grunt-sass `npm install grunt-sass`


#Building
Once you have the dependancies installed, run `grunt` from the project directory. This will run the default grunt task which only compiles the SCSS files into `hint.css` file.
